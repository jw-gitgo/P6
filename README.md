### Summary
This data visualization attempts to explore whether the world is really getting more dangerous to live in (a commonly held belief, from my experience), based on publicly-available data from the World Health Organization.  The key metric used to explore this is the percentage of total deaths that are caused by external factors, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standards.  "External Factors" refers to all causes of death other than internal diseases and symptoms:  transport accidents, household accidents, falls, homicide, warfare, terrorism, intentional self-harm, etc.
